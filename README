qft++
Numerical Object Oriented Quantum Field Theory Calculations
- Created by Mike Williams

The qft++ package is a library of C++ classes that facilitate numerical (not algebraic) quantum field theory calculations. Mathematical objects such as matrices, tensors, Dirac spinors, polarization and orbital angular momentum tensors, etc. are represented as C++ objects in qft++. The package permits construction of code which closely resembles quantum field theory expressions, allowing for quick and reliable calculations.

Build Instructions
Type 'scons' in the base directory

Install Instructions
Type '(sudo) scons --install=<install dir>'

For installation a mac, it's best to create a virtualenv for this project 
pip install virtualenv
virtualenv qft 
cd qft/bin/
source activate
#from this point you are inside your virtualenv
pip install scons 
scons 
cd qft/bin/
pico setup.sh
#add the following two lines in the setup.sh file
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:<where you cloned the package>/qft/lib/
export DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH=$DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH:<<where you cloned the package>qft/lib/

cd tutorial 
./gamma.p--p.pi_thru_t-channel-rho-exchange 

Have fun.
